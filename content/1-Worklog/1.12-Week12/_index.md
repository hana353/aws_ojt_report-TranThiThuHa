### Week 12 Achievements:

* Completed the final AWS project combining multiple important services:
  * Designed scalable architecture with VPC, subnets, and security groups
  * Implemented storage solutions with S3 and CloudFront CDN
  * Built database layer with RDS or DynamoDB
  * Created serverless backend with Lambda and API Gateway
  * Integrated monitoring with CloudWatch

* Self-designed architecture, deployed, optimized, and operated a real-world system:
  * Applied best practices for security (IAM, Security Groups, encryption)
  * Implemented high availability and fault tolerance
  * Configured auto-scaling for cost optimization
  * Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

* Mastered the process of building Cloud applications from start to finish:
  * Requirements analysis and architecture design
  * Infrastructure provisioning and configuration
  * Application deployment and testing
  * Monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting
  * Documentation and presentation

* Completed the 12-week AWS learning roadmap:
  * Week 1-5: Explored AWS Services (Compute, Storage, Networking, Database)
  * Week 6-8: Optimizing Operations (Lambda, CloudFormation, CDK, Systems Manager)
  * Week 9-11: Optimizing Security (IAM, WAF, KMS, GuardDuty, Cognito)
  * Week 12: Final Project and Summary

* Ready to apply knowledge to large-scale or real-world projects

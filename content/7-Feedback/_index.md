> This section provides my personal reflections and feedback on my experience participating in the **First Cloud Journey (FCJ) AWS Cloud Engineer Internship Program**. I hope these insights will help the FCJ team continuously improve the program and provide even better experiences for future interns.

## Overall Evaluation

### 1. Working Environment

The working environment at FCJ is **exceptionally supportive and conducive to learning**. From the very first week, I felt welcomed and integrated into the team. The remote/hybrid working model provided flexibility while maintaining clear communication channels through regular check-ins and collaborative platforms.

What impressed me most was the **culture of knowledge sharing** - team members were always willing to help, whether it was troubleshooting a CloudFormation deployment issue or explaining complex AWS service architectures. The structured 12-week learning path at [cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com](https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/) provided clear direction while allowing room for exploration and hands-on practice.

**Suggestion:** Consider organizing more virtual networking sessions or technical workshops where interns can interact with senior engineers and learn about real-world cloud projects.

### 2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin

The mentorship I received was **outstanding and truly transformative**. My mentor didn't just provide answers but guided me through problem-solving processes, which significantly enhanced my technical thinking and troubleshooting abilities.

**Key highlights:**
- **Structured guidance** through the 12-week curriculum covering AWS fundamentals, operations optimization, and security best practices
- **Encouragement of independent learning** - I was encouraged to explore AWS documentation, experiment with services, and learn from mistakes
- **Timely feedback** on my worklog entries and project implementations
- **Real-world context** - explanations of how concepts apply in production environments

The admin team was equally supportive, ensuring all necessary resources, AWS account access, and documentation were readily available. The onboarding process was smooth and well-organized.

**Suggestion:** Perhaps introduce a peer mentoring system where previous interns can share their experiences with new cohorts.

### 3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major

The internship program was **highly relevant** to my Information Technology major and perfectly bridged the gap between academic knowledge and industry practice.

**Alignment with academic learning:**
- Applied networking concepts (VPC, subnets, security groups) learned in university
- Practiced database management with RDS and DynamoDB
- Implemented security principles through IAM, WAF, and encryption services
- Applied software engineering practices with Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, CDK)

**New areas explored:**
- Cloud-native architectures and serverless computing (Lambda, API Gateway)
- DevOps practices (CI/CD pipelines, monitoring with CloudWatch)
- Cost optimization strategies and resource right-sizing
- Enterprise security frameworks (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Macie)

The progression from basic AWS services (Weeks 1-5) to operations optimization (Weeks 6-8) and security (Weeks 9-11) was well-designed and built upon previous knowledge systematically.

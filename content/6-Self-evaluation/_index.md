During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **September 8, 2025** to **November 28, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in the **AWS Cloud Engineer internship program** following the 12-week learning path at cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com, through which I improved my skills in **AWS cloud services, Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, CDK), monitoring and logging (CloudWatch, Grafana), security best practices (IAM, WAF, KMS, GuardDuty), cost optimization, and CI/CD pipelines**.  

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency. Throughout the 12 weeks, I systematically explored AWS services (Weeks 1-5), optimized operations (Weeks 6-8), enhanced security practices (Weeks 9-11), and completed a comprehensive final project building a complete AWS architecture (Week 12).

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
